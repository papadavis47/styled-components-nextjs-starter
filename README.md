# My Styled Components Starter for Next.js

This is a starter template for any project I make using styled-components - one of my favorite CSS
solutions.

The following is the command to run to start a new project:

`yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/papadavis47/styled-components-nextjs-starter <title of project>`
